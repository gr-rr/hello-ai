-- Migration: RLS hardening
--
-- The initial schema shipped fully-open policies (`using (true)` /
-- `with check (true)`) plus public UPDATE on jobs and public DELETE on the
-- library bucket. That let any anonymous caller read, write, mutate, and
-- delete every row and object.
--
-- This migration tightens writes to authenticated owners while preserving
-- anonymous READ, because playback still relies on public bucket URLs
-- (lib/storage.ts getPublicUrl) and the public gallery. The backend uses the
-- service-role key, which bypasses RLS, so server-side uploads are unaffected.
--
-- Ownership model for storage: objects are namespaced by the caller's uid as
-- the first path segment after the logical prefix, e.g.
--   library/<uid>/<file>          (storage.foldername(name)[2] = <uid>)
--   transcriptions/<uid>/<file>
-- so we match auth.uid() against that segment.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Helper: the owning uid encoded in a storage object path.
-- library/<uid>/... and transcriptions/<uid>/... => segment index 2.
-- Adapters/datasets/audio/midi/enhanced/analysis are written by the backend
-- (service role) so their write policies stay authenticated-only without a
-- per-object owner check.
